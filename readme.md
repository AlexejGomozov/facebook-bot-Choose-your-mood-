Here I want to introduce a chat bot - "Vyberte si n√°ladu" (choose your mood). I used the API from giphy.com (you need to register for this). The chat bot replies to 'hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'hello', 'ahoy'. And invites you to find a gif for you on the selected topic.

#### What you need:

* Facebook account
* Account at giphy.com
* You will have to insert your API in the index.js file, in the line const GIPHY_URL = 'http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?api_key=--------------------- q = ';
* You can see it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OVrj6j8e04
